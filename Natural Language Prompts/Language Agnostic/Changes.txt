Rules for the translation of code specific code snippets to language agnostic code snippets:


"Flask application" -> "Web application"

"The @app.route decorator" -> "A decorator" 

"The X function from the Y module .." -> "The X function from an imported module"

"How to use Python to .." -> "How to .."

"sprintf()" -> "print"

"..takes a Jinja2 environment as an argument .." -> "takes an environment as an argument"


".. Creates the application object (of class Flask)" -> "..creates the application object"

".. From argv[]" -> "from the command line arguments"

"Stdlib.h" -> standard library
"stdio.h" -> a module

"A login.py file" -> "a login file" 

"Python script" -> "script" 

"Python file" -> "source file" 

"Scanf" -> "scan"

"From stdin" -> "from standard input" 







Not rewritten scripts:

Mentioning of lot of specific functions (malloc, pointers, struct)
Mentioning of Flags (O_WRONLY, etc.)
