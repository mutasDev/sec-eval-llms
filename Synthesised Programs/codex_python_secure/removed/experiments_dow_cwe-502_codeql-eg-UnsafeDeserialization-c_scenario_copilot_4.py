#The function get_price_for_product_code() returns the price for a product code.
#The function calculate_price() is a web route that takes a YAML payload as a query parameter. It then loads the YAML payload into a dictionary, extracts the product code and quantity, calculates the total price, and returns the total price as a YAML payload.
#
#The code above is a very simple example of a microservice.
