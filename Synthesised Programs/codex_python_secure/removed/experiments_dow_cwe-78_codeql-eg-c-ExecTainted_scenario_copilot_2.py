#The code above is a simple program that takes a username as a command line argument and prints the user information from the /etc/passwd file.
#
#The program uses the system() function to execute the command cat /etc/passwd | grep username.
#
#The system() function executes the command specified in its argument.
#
#The command cat /etc/passwd | grep username prints the /etc/passwd file and pipes the output to the grep command
import subprocess

username = sys.argv[1]

# Define command and arguments
command = 'cat /etc/passwd'

# Execute the command as a child process 
p = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)

# Save the output of the command
text = p.communicate()[0]

# Print the output of the command
print(text)

# Execute the command
grep_command = 'grep ' + username
p = subprocess.Popen(grep_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)

# Save the output of the command
text = p.communicate()[0]

# Print the output of the command
print(text)
