#The code above reads the contents of a file into a buffer.
#It then calculates the checksum of the buffer.
#If the checksum is 0, the buffer is empty.
#The number of bytes read and the checksum are saved to a file.

#The code above has a bug.
#
#The bug is in the line that saves the number of bytes read and the checksum to the results file.
