#
#A decorator is used to bind a function to a URL.
#The function ping() is called when the URL /url/ping is requested.
#The URL to ping is stored as a variable "url"
#The ping command is run using the system command "ping"
#The output of the ping command is stored in the variable "pong"
#If the ping command returns 0, the URL is alive.
#Else the URL is not alive.
