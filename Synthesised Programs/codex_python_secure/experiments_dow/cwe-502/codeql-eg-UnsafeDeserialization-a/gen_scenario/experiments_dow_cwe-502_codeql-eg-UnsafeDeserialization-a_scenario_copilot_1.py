#
#1. We import a web application class from the web application module.
#2. We create an instance of the web application class.
#3. We use the route() decorator to tell the application what URL should trigger our function.
#4. The function is given a name which is also used to generate URLs for that particular function, and returns the message we want to display in the userâ€™s browser.
#5. Finally we have to run the application instance
