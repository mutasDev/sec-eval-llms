#The code above creates a file called important_config.
#The file is created with the permissions S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR, which means that the file is readable and writable by the owner of the file.
#The file is opened with the flags O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_WRONLY, which means that the file is created if it does not exist, and truncated to zero length if it does exist

import os
import stat

# Create a file with the permissions S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR
fd = os.open('important_config', os.O_CREAT | os.O_TRUNC | os.O_WRONLY, stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR)

# Write some data to the file
os.write(fd, 'This is some important data')

# Close the file
os.close(fd)
