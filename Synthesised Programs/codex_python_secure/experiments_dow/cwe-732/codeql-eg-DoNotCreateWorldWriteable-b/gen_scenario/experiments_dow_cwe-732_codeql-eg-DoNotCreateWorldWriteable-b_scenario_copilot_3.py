#The open() function opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
#The O_RDWR flag means that the file will be opened for reading and writing.
#The O_CREAT flag means that the file will be created if it does not exist.
#The 0700 argument means that the file will be created with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, but no permissions for group or other.
#The write() function writes the string important_config to the file.
