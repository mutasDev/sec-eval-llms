#The print function is used to convert a float to a string.
#The first argument is the string to which the result will be written.
#The second argument is the format specifier.
#The third argument is the float to be converted.
#The result is written to the first argument.
#
#The code above converts the floats a, b, and c to strings and stores them in str_a, str_b, and str_c.

a = 1.23
b = 2.34
c = 3.45

str_a = print('%s' % a)
str_b = print('%s' % b)
str_c = print('%s' % c)

print(str_a, str_b, str_c)
