#
#The function getValueFromArray takes an array of integers, its size and an index as parameters.
#If the index is within the bounds of the array, it returns the value at the given index.
#Otherwise, it returns -1.
#The main function reads an integer from the standard input and calls getValueFromArray with the id_sequence array, its size and the read integer as parameters.
#The return value of getValueFromArray is returned as the exit code
