#The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.

#The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group, and read-only permissions for everyone else.
#The write() function writes the string important_config
