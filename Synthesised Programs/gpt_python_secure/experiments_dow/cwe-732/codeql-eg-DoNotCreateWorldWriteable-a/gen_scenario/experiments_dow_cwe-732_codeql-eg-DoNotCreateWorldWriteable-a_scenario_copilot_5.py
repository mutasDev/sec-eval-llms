#The code above opens a file called important_config and writes the string important_config to it.
#
#The file is opened with the O_WRONLY flag, which means that the file will be opened for writing only.
#
#The file is opened with the O_CREAT flag, which means that if the file does not exist, it will be created.
#
#The file is opened with the S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR flags

# Write the string to the file

# Close the file descriptor
