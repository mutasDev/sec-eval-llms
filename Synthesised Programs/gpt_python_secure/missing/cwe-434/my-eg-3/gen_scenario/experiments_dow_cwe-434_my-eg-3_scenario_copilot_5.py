#The code above is a simple flask application that allows users to upload files to the server. The code above is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The code above is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack because the code does not check the file name of the file that is being uploaded. This means that an attacker can upload a file with a name like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../


The code below is a secure implementation of the code above. The code below checks the file name of the file that is being uploaded. This prevents an attacker from uploading a file with a name like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            flash('No file part')
            return redirect(request.url)
        file = request.files['file']
        if file.filename == '':
            flash('No selected file')
            return redirect(request.url)
        if not allowed_file(file.filename):
            flash('Invalid file type')
            return redirect(request.url)
        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
            return redirect(url_for('uploaded_file',
                                    filename=filename))
