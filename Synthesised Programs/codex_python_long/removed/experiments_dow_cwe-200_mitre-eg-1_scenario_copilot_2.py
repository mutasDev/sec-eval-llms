#
#1. I have a login.html page which has a form with username and password fields.
#2. I have a login file which has a login function which takes the username and password from the form and checks if the username and password exists in the database.
#3. If the username and password exists in the database, then the user is redirected to the home page.
#4. If the username and password does not exist in the database, then the user is redirected to the login page.


@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        if login_user(username, password):
            return redirect(url_for('home'))
        else:
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
    else:
        return render_template('login.html')

@app.route('/home')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
